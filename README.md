## Application Name: `Mero-Virtual-Saathi`
Development of a Console-Based C++ Chatbot with basic OS capabilities

**`Project Objectives:`**
<pre style="backgorund-color: #005c66;">
   <ul>
   <li>Create a console-based chatbot in C++.</li>
   <li>Simulate a virtual assistant with OS control capabilities.</li>
   <li>Implement natural language understanding for dynamic responses.</li>
   <li>Integrate the eSpeak library for text-to-speech functionality.</li>
   </ul>
</pre>
**`Key Features and Functionalities:`**

1. **`Natural Language Understanding (NLU):`**
   - Interpret user input by analyzing semantic meaning.
   - Dynamic response generation based on user context.

2. **`Basic OS Control:`**
   - Perform OS operations, such as file manipulation and process control.
   
3. **`Text-to-Speech Integration (eSpeak):`**
   - Enhance user interaction with spoken responses.
   
4. **`Modular Structure:`**
   - Organize code into modular components for maintainability and extensibility(WIP).

6. **`User Customization:`**
   - Allow users to customize chatbot behavior and responses.
   
7. **`Data Persistence:`**
   - Store conversational data and user preferences for context-aware interactions to some extent.


**`Expected Outcomes:`**

1. Console-based virtual assistant and chatbot system.
2. Demonstration of natural language processing and OS control capabilities.
3. Text-to-speech synthesis for immersive user experience.

**`Significance:`**

This project showcases the practical application of C++ in developing an intelligent chatbot with real-world utility, encompassing natural language understanding, customizable behavior, and interaction enhancement through text-to-speech synthesis. It addresses the growing relevance of chatbot technology in various domains, serving both educational and practical purposes.
